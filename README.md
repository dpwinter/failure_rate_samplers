# failure_rate_samplers
> Collection of algorithms to sample logical failure rate of quantum error correction circuits

These studies predate and informed the development of the `qsam` quantum protocol sampler. In this repository the direct and subset sampling approach for quantum circuits is implemented and further analysed.
